    <h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>1990s kids, the generation, which will create future!</strong></h1>
<p>Hello world!</p>
<p>If  you are reading this document, it means that I have chosen you as a trusted member of our secret group called <strong>StrongHumanNetwork</strong>.</p>
<p>What  is  StrongHumanNetwork?<br/>
It is a network of StrongHumans. Let us define a StrongHuman. I have come up with a comprehensive definition from my own experiences in life.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">A StrongHuman is a confident, self-aware individual with a fair world exposure and a direction in life, who is willing to work on oneself with a set of tools to achieve one's excellence potential!</p>
<p><strong>Confidence:</strong><br/>
Confidence is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you think you can do something, you will do it. If you think you can’t do something, of course you can’t do it! Every strong human needs it.</p>

<p><strong>Self-awareness:</strong><br/>
Self-awareness is single most important concept which can define any individual, change his life completely and responsible for success. There are multiple aspects of self-awareness.</p>
<ol>
<li>Behavioral – feelings, emotions, judgment, opinion, buying behavior, belief etc</li>
<li>Relationship – with parents, siblings, friends, reporting managers, subordinates, strangers, objects, god</li>
<li>Health – food, lifestyle, fitness</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>World exposure:</strong><br/>
Everyone needs to know what is happening around them as it directly impacts them. Everyone needs to know it to an extent where it will help him achieve his goals.</p>

<p><strong>Direction in life:</strong><br/>
If one has confidence, certain level of self-awareness and world exposure he will attain a direction in life.</p>

<p><strong>Tools:</strong><br/>
Even early man had to  create tools for survival. When we want to be a strong human and work towards happiness and self-enlightenment, we need to create tools to achieve them. It might just be as simple as a habit, or a framework, which can change people’s perspective on things.</p>

<p>If all these are there with a person who is willing to work on himself then he will achieve his excellence potential.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Humanity’s goal is excellence. Period!</strong></p>

<p>Okay, so what exactly do you want to do?</p>

<p>I want everyone on this planet to work on excellence. That’s possible if everyone becomes a strong human. I want to create an eco system, which creates strong humans!</p>

<p>How do you create this system?</p>

<p>Basically a human being is a sensible person in his purest form. He uses it in various ways as per his situation in life. Currently most of the humanity including India has crossed survival stage in Maslow’s pyramid of needs and next phase is happiness followed by self-enlightenment. During this transition  there is lot of noise, which stops him from focusing on happiness and self-enlightenment. Example: corruption, which is a mechanism to safeguard future  generations for survival without understanding that his future generations will not need survival or comforts(which excessive money can buy) but happiness and self enlightenment.</p>

<p>My idea is to create a system to remove the noise and put the human in a sensible environment where he can freely think and do what he wants to do in life.</p>

<p>Can you be more specific?</p>

<p>Consider this:<br/>
<span style="text-align:center; display:block;">1-month residential personality development program</span></p>

<p>Pedagogy: Lectures, activities, artistic content exposure from a similar society and different society, one on one mentoring with a strong human, self reflection time, diverse set of co-participants</p>

<p>Deliverables: Confidence, kicking off self-awareness journey, giving a direction in life, helping in choosing the right tools, Introducing the world, lifetime membership to SHN(StrongHumanNetwork)</p>

<p>Who will be the target audience?<br/>
Anyone willing to work on himself. If you apply 80-20 rule, most of our audience will be in 18-30 age group.</p>

<p>Okay, so you want to create a business from personality development?<br/>
Yes and No.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">If you are looking at personality development as a standalone business then “No”</p>

<p>You need to understand personality development (PD) at a deeper level. Through PD, you are changing one person at a time which means that you are 
changing the society. When you are changing the society it is a revolution! When society changes, everything changes, especially the businesses, as business is just a value sharing between different people.</p>

<p>So you say, you are going to change the world? All by yourself?<br/>
Again Yes and No</p>

<p>Yes, because I will play a very crucial role in this whole journey and it starts from changing myself for better.</p>

<p>No because this will happen eventually. I realizing this at this moment is just benefitting me more and accelerating the whole system. Moreover this is a 
situation where everyone works together to get into a win-win situation. Hence it is going to be a happier place than now and eventually everyone will come  
together.</p>

<p>Tell me more…!</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning  are the next  two big things. Machine is becoming smarter, which means there will be no menial jobs in future, which further means people should either depend on government support or do skilled jobs. Personality development is  needed  to  enhance any skilled job(A carpenter will be better if he knows how to sell his work). Government is working on skill development, but no one is working on a holistic personality development at a grass root level with detailed focus. So there is a huge need for PD.</p>

<p>This can be used to generate wealth for the society in many ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>by creating better human beings</li>
<li>by creating better businesses. Human resource/capital is integral for growth of any firm.</li>
<li>by creating better lifestyle which will help in achieving excellence at personal level</li>
</ol>

<p>Tell me how it will change businesses?<br/>
If people are more rational their buying decisions are much more better. This cause and effect will straightaway align businesses to cater the need of changed 
consumer with highly focused customer satisfaction strategy</p>

<p>What else does it impact?<br/>
It will impact every process and people involved in business. Education, food, healthcare, tourism, entertainment are some industries which will drastically 
change.</p>

<p>Why do you think “YOU” will be able to do it?<br/>
Because I am just 27 and the whole future is  mine. I will live atleast 100 more years and I want to see very interesting things happening in these 100 years. I am not bothered about the current realities because 1990s kids can change everything! Period!</p>

<p>You seem to be flying in your dreams; do you have an executable plan?<br/>
Yes! I chose to show you only the part of the plan, which I want you to know!</p>

<p>Sounds good, lets  start working on it. What should I do?</p>

<p>Wait for my next message&#9786;</p>
